## Loyola Biodiesel Program 

**Project Impact**

Our project makes a real-world impact in addressing the challenge by utilizing waste products to create energy. Our products are designed to utilize university and lab waste to make usable products with the long term goal of establishing a zero waste process. The Biodiesel Program also accepts donations of used cooking oil to be turned into biodiesel. For buinesses and instituions in the Chicago area Loyola has a professional oil collection service (Green Grease Environmental) who can pick-up cooking oil at restaurants, cafeterias, or food processing facilities at no cost.

### Biofuel 

One of the products of this program is biofuel, an alternative fuel source that produces lower toxic emissions. The intercampus shuttle buses at Loyola use biofuel and biofuel is also sold to other universities in the area for use their shuttle buses. 

### BioSoap

We want to create biodiesel in a sustainable way and part of this means creating as little waste as possible. One of the by-products of biodiesel production is glycerin. After distilling excess methanol out of the glycerin, to be reused in biodiesel production, the glycerin can be used as an ingredient in soap. This allows us to be one step closer to closing the loop and creating less waste. 

After a consistent, high-quality recipe was created in small batches we decided to scale up and start distributing liquid soap on campus. It took some time to master the process and scale-up the recipe, but after several months and finding the right equipment, the process was perfected and the liquid soap, BioSoap, is used in all buildings on campus.
