# Biodiesel

## Biodiesel Production

Biodiesel can be made from any vegetable oil or animal fat through a chemical reaction called transesterification. Through this chemical reaction, long hydrocarbon chain (fatty acids) can be isolated, and later refined, to create a biodegradable, non-toxic, non-flammable, drop-in replacement for petroleum diesel fuel.

## Biodiesel Fuel

Biodiesel is a renewable replacement for petroleum diesel fuel that drastically reduces emissions. It works in most diesel engine applications with little (or no) modifications/changes to how you use your engine.
