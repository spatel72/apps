### Engineering

Free Clean Energy's fully automated, fuel processing system is engineered to a utility grade duty cycle.  Our unique process has a vertically integrated design that is modular, scalable and flexible.

### Consulting

We perform fuel audits and feasibility studies to determine if sufficient markets and materials are available to ensure project success. We are experts in converting post-consumer waste into a clean predictable homogenous fuel that can be used to displace fossil fuels in existing industrial boilers and kilns.

### Market Development

The price of energy is determined by the cost of fuel. Energy created from fossil fuel is historically expensive and dirty. The PEF produced from clean energy technology is low cost and in demand to replace coal in boilers and kilns.
