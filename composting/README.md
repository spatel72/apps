# Composting

Organic materials, like landscape waste and food, decompose naturally. The result is a nutrient-rich mixture called compost that provides minerals and nutrients for growing plants. This compost can be used on gardens and agricultural fields to help soil retain moisture, provide nutrients for plants, reduce the need for fertilizers. Without the separate collection of food waste for composting, this valuable resource goes to waste in a landfill.
